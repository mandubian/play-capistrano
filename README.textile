h1. Play Capistrano Module

bq. *Very draft of the module, contributions are welcome*

This is a very first draft of a Play module allowing to deploy easily a play app on a remote server with "Capistrano":https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/Documentation-v2.x, this marvelous remote control tool!
Capistrano is written in Ruby and if you are like me, a complete noob in Ruby, you certainly don't want to write any line of Ruby within a Play application.
This module is aimed at that without preventing people more skilled in Capistrano and Ruby to do what they want.

h2. How-To

h2. Install/Learn Capistrano

I had problems using Ubuntu Synaptic packages so I installed manually with RVM and this is perfect. Go "there":http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/

To learn the basics of Capistrano, go "there":https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/2.x-From-The-Beginning

h2. Install Play Capistrano module in your _conf/dependencies.yml_

bc. play -> capistrano 1.0.0

bq. Don't forget to run the traditional @play deps@

h2. Run the *play capify* command

Play-Capistrano module is delivered with one single command for the time being:

bc. play capify

This command copies the following required Capistrano files to your project _(this is not perfect because it duplicates files from module)_:
* *Capfile* : the file expected by Capistrano containing the main entry point for it
* *conf/play-recipes.rb* : the _deploy_ commands traditionaly provided by capistrano and tuned to Play
* *conf/deploy.rb* : the specific configuration file containing the remote servers/VCS addresses *YOU MUST EDIT THIS FILE AND PUT YOUR CONFIG IN IT*
* *run.sh* : a simple shell file (yes only linux support currently) containing the command to launch Play server in background. 

bq. For an unknown reason, it's impossible to run a background shell command from capistrano directly and you must wrap it into a shell.


h2. Edit conf/deploy.rb with your remote/VCS config

Just edit the file and replace parts in UPPER CASE

h2. Then you enter into Capistrano world...

h2. The tweaked Capistrano Play recipes

Thanks to "this Stackoverflow post":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7416662/capistrano-and-playframework for giving me a very good ground knowing my complete incompetence in Ruby:

h3. cap deploy:start

This remote start the server in nohup using the run.sh to make it background.

h3. cap deploy:stop

This remote stops the server.

h3. cap play:logs

This "tail -f" remote logs.

h3. cap play:kill 

This kills the remote server

h3. cap play:viewprocess

This view remote process info
